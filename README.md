# Updating-Prices
I developed this code thinking about businesses that deal with high levels of monthly inflation (like Argentina). The idea is that the code takes an Excel with different categories, updates the prices based on the inflation supplied for each of them, and returns an Excel and an updated PDF with the supplied prices.

For executing this code you need an Excel file with at least one sheet (each category is represented in each sheet), each sheet contains several products with their prices. 
When you run the code, the program will prompt you a percentage of inflation for each category (each sheet) that you want to apply the modifications to. 
Once you are done, you'll receive a new Excel file and a PDF with the details.

I create and execute this code with Visual Studio Code.
